# Environment

__The goal of this section is to install required software to run this tutorial.__

I'm working on Linux/Debian, so you must probably search information about how to
install these tools on your OS.

On Debian, install `qemu` and `nasm`:
```bash
$ sudo apt install qemu nasm
```
